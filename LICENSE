# Slideball

[insert gif of demo here]

A multiplayer, turn-based demo that showcases how a Javascript client and an Elixir server can share code.
The code that simulates the physics of the sliding balls is written
in Rust and is shared between the client and server.

This can be helpful when creating web games because it saves the time of having to rewrite the simulation code in two different languages.
Additionally, there is consistency between the client and server calculations.

The client and server communicate with websockets. A Postgres database is used to
save the color of ball that an authorized user selects. Whenever that player signs in again, their ball will start as the color of their choice.
